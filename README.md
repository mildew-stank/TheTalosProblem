# About
In this 2D world you can stack boxes to gain height. To gain the most height with a given number of boxes you will need to pull the ladder up from under yourself, so to speak, by moving lower boxes to higher positions. 

# Usage
Run main.py through [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and enter a height to get the minimum number of boxes required to reach it, along with a representation of the final stack layout.

This is essentially a sorting algorithm with a two-step process as defined in `stack_right()` and `swap_left()` that gets repeated until improvements cease.

From stacking import Ruleset if you want to come up with your own solution.
